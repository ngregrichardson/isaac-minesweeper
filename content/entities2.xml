<!--
 - Add an id field in order to make an entity of the type you want.
   For exemple, if you wanted to make a new type of bomb, put `id="4"`.
 - Add a `variant="n"` if you are having issues getting your entity
   to appear in the game.
 - Control the speed of your enemy with `friction`.
   That value is between 0 and 1, values greater than 1 might make
   your entity accelerate to uncontrolable speeds.
 - The `portrait` fields control what pictures show when the entity kills the
   player.
 - Put the `collisionDamage` value to "0" if you want the entity to be
   harmless when directly hitting the player.
