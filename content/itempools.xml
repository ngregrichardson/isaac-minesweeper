<!--
Note: imagine that each item adds a number of tokens to the item pool.
Each time the game must generate an item pedestal, it takes out a random
token from the item pool and puts the item on the pedestal.

 - `weight` the number of tokens to put in the pool for your item. Greater
   values makes your item more likely to show up.

 - `decreaseby` Number of tokens to remove from the pool when
   the player **sees** the item. Greater numbers means you are
   less likely to see the item after having seen it once.

 - `removeon` Minimum number of tokens to accept the item in the pool.
   If your item has less token remaining than the `removeon` value,
   the player won't see it anymore, even if there is remaining tokens.

 - Note that item weights might be pool dependent.

 - Note that picking up the item will remove it from all the pools it is in.

 - All values can be natural or rational numbers.
