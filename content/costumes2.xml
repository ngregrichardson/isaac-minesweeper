<!--
 - Put a `name` field so the game recognizes for which item it should give
   the player a costum. If you leave it empty, several items might give you
   the same costume.
 - the `priority`  field controls on which costum layer the costum is applied
   for exemple, priority="1" would put the costum behind isaac's head, and
   priority="99" would put the costum in front of all other costums
